    <!-- TASK 1 (mandatory): Analyze the layout below. For each section, decide which semantic tag (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.) is most appropriate and explain your reasoning in a comment above each tag you use. Do NOT just replace tagsâ€”think about the purpose of each part. Do not remove the divs until you have justified your choices. -->
    
    <header>
        <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
    </header>
    <!-- The header is the content which the reader will first see, so it is appropriate to use the <header> tag here. -->
    <main>
        
        <article>
            <h2>What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
            <p>It's a way of writing HTML that gives meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.</p>
        </article>
        <!-- The article tag is used here as it represents the main question and answer, in this case paragraph and h2, so it is appropiate to use it here.-->
        <!-- TASK 3: Add a second blog post, using the correct semantic tag(s). For each semantic tag you use, add a comment explaining your choice. Also, use aria-label attributes where appropriate for accessibility. -->
        <!-- 
        <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
        <p></p>
        -->

    </main>
    <!-- The main tag is used here because it groups the main content together, which is the main question and answer aka. the purpose of this website. -->
    <!-- TASK 2: Identify information that is related but not part of the main content. Add a sidebar using the correct semantic tag, and explain in a comment why you chose that tag and what content belongs there. -->
     <aside>
        <h2>Related Topics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Section Tag</li>
            <li> I replaced section with article as article is more appropiate, the main content has a question and answer, therefore section isnt used here</li>
     </aside>
    <footer>
        <p>Made with HTML</p>
    </footer>
    <!-- The footer tag is used in this part to indicate the end of the page, so it is appropriate to use it in here as it is the end:)-->
